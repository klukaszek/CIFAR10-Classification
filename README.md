Various Feed Forward Neural Network Implementations and Comparisons.

## Outline

Implements and evaluates various feed-forward neural networks using the CIFAR10 image dataset.

The first model uses a sigmoid activation function, and the other models use ReLU.

Tests various hyperparameters for the models and reports accuracy for the models using these hyperparameters.

I can't post the assignment outline in the repository, but the Jupyter Notebook is pretty straightforward and explains a lot.
